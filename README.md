# Theory Notes  

This repository contains short theoretical physics notes and small projects.  
I use it as a space to organize my learning process and share progress publicly.  

## Current Focus  
- **Special Relativity** â†’ Rapidity & Pseudorapidity  
- Connections between Lorentz transformations and hyperbolic geometry  

## Upcoming Topics  
- Introductory notes on Quantum Mechanics  
- Statistical Mechanics mini projects  
- Numerical simulations (Python, simple Ising model)
